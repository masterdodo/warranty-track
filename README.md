# Flutter Warranty Tracker App

I made this app to help me track my warranties for different products and services.
With it I can quickly check which products are still active, which paperwork do I have to keep and which I can destroy.

(Also learning Flutter 2 along the way, so references include Flutter 2 knowledge.)

## Features
1. CRUD Warranty (**TODO**)
2. Add a bill of the product (**TODO**)
3. Check active warranties and time left (**TODO**)

# Versions

Working on:
- Flutter: **2.10.0**
- Dart: **2.16.0**
